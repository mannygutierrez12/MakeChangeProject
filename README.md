#How this project works.

The idea behind creating this cash register machine is to assist employees in choosing the right amount as well as the highest possible denomination. For instance, if a purchase costs 59.75 cents, giving the customer 5 nickels and 40 1-dollar bills would be cumbersome. In this case, the program will prompt that the most efficient way to give the remaining money back to the customer would be 2 20-dollar bills and 1 quarter. We must emphasize that the largest denomination is the 20-dollar bill, and the smallest denomination would be 1 cent or better known as a penny.

Each bill would use its respective denomination. For instance, a 20-dollar bill would be referred to as just a "20-dollar bill." The same happens for bills of 1, 5, and 10. On the other hand, any amount inferior would be referred to using colloquial American names. Please see the example below.

25 cents = Quarter
10 cents = Dime
05 cents = Nickel
01 cent = Penny
At the end of the program, the user would be asked one time if he or she would like to perform any other calculation. If the user chooses "yes," the method would be recalled, and he or she can continue performing a calculation. If the user chooses "no," the program would prompt a goodbye message.

#Lessons Learned

We learned how to use the knowledge acquired during the first week of class to put everything together and create a non-GUI application. I think the first version of this program would be the first step, but the program has lots of potential to improve. For instance, a loop could be created to encrypt a password that only authorized users can use.

We could create a message that would pop up every time the machine is running low on a certain bill.

We could create a while loop that keeps count of the money by creating a first count and comparing it with the last count, providing the user with the money available at a specific time.

These are just small examples of things that might be possible, but the opportunities are endless.
